He likens Marshall being single to a kid in a candy store, with any candy ready for his picking. Barney tells him that he'll be Marshall's wing man in picking up girls. Their nights out don't quite work out that way, but when the opportunity finally arrives for Marshall and a potential date, Marshall doesn't seem to know what to do. Meanwhile, Robin receives a surprise visit: from Lily. Lily implies that she had the best summer in San Francisco, not only with the art fellowship, but with life overall. Robin tells Ted about Lily's return, the two who argue about whether they should tell Marshall. But when Ted finally sees Lily, he has a different point of view.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTE0MTE0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE5MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"8.3","imdbVotes":"1616","imdbID":"tt0869673","seriesID":"tt0460649","Type":"episode","Response":"True"}
