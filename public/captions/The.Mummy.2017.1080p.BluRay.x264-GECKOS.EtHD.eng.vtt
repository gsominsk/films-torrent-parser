1
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.231
What the hell is this?

2
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.994
I don't know.

3
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720
Whoa.

4
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.113
Bloody hell.

5
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.550
The Crossrail is the biggest
construction project in Europe,

6
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.513
<i>carving 26 miles of new
commuter train tunnels</i>

7
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.953
<i>beneath the surface
of London.</i>

8
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.392
<i>But today, an ancient tomb filled with
the coffins of Crusader knights...</i>

9
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.616
<i>People don't realize</i>

10
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.631
<i>that London is
a giant graveyard.</i>

11
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.553
A modern city built
on centuries of death.

12
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.576
<i>Because of the
tomb's proximity to the Thames,</i>

13
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.896
<i>half the space is flooded,
is that right?</i>

14
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.256
<i>There are even more
coffins submerged underwater.</i>

15
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.720
<i>The tomb appears to have been
built during the Second Crusade,</i>

16
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.035
<i>which means it's filled
with the bodies</i>

17
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.616
of Crusader knights
who invaded Egypt

18
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.868
before returning to England.

19
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.076
<i>It has also
revealed a treasure trove</i>

20
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.316
<i>of secrets about
London's history.</i>

21
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.591
Clear them out, please.

22
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.391
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stop what you're doing.

23
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.313
The train tunnel has been
rerouted north of here.

24
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.428
We are now taking
control of this site.

25
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.549
Please collect your tools and
gear and exit immediately.

26
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.195
Oi!

27
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.396
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

28
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.119
This is my site.
What do you think you're doing?

29
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.031
Evacuate your men.

30
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.997
We'll take it
from here.

31
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.196
Who the hell are you people?

32
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.875
This way, sir.
Thank you very much.

33
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.758
<i>The past cannot
remain buried forever.</i>

34
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.508
<i>In my lifetime, I have unearthed
many ancient mysteries.</i>

35
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.156
<i>At last, this tomb reveals
antiquity's darkest secret.</i>

36
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.191
<i>A secret erased from history
and forgotten to time.</i>

37
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.589
<i>Princess Ahmanet.</i>

38
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.398
<i>Beautiful,</i>

39
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.554
<i>cunning,</i>

40
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.632
<i>and ruthless.</i>

41
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.874
<i>Sole heir to
the throne of Egypt.</i>

42
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.391
<i>The pharaoh's kingdom
would one day be hers to rule</i>

43
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.916
<i>without mercy or fear.</i>

44
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.754
<i>And Ahmanet would be
worshiped as a living god.</i>

45
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.558
<i>But Pharaoh had a son.</i>

46
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.111
<i>The boy, now,
would inherit her destiny.</i>

47
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.349
<i>And Ahmanet understood
power was not given.</i>

48
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.956
<i>It had to be taken.</i>

49
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.157
<i>Vowing revenge,
she made a choice to embrace evil.</i>

50
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.269
<i>Set. The god of death.</i>

51
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.831
<i>They made a pact.</i>

52
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.828
<i>A pact that would
unleash darkness itself.</i>

53
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.950
<i>Ahmanet was reborn</i>

54
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.311
<i>a monster.</i>

55
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.160
<i>Yet the pact was not complete.</i>

56
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.552
<i>She vowed to bring the demon into our
world in the body of a mortal man.</i>

57
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.549
<i>Together, they would take
their vengeance upon humanity.</i>

58
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.719
<i>For her sins,
Ahmanet was mummified alive,</i>

59
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.917
<i>her body carried
far from Egypt.</i>

60
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.079
<i>There she would remain,
condemned to eternal darkness.</i>

61
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:11.237
<i>But death is a doorway, and the
past cannot remain buried forever.</i>

62
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.758
<i>Out of luck,
huh, Sarge?</i>

63
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.074
<i>The civilians are gone.</i>

64
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.396
It's filled with
insurgents down there.

65
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.075
I guess we're too late.

66
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480
We can do this.

67
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.431
Oh, no, no, no!
We are too late!

68
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.715
Command thinks we're
doing advanced recon

69
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.552
100 miles from here.

70
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.198
Sarge, you're not
going down there.

71
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.356
You're right, I'm not.

72
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.475
We are.

73
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.073
At least call in
an airstrike.

74
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.633
"Airstrike"?

75
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720
Bad idea.

76
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.376
A little one. Just...
Maybe they'll run off.

77
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.616
And then command will
know where we are...

78
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.313
And we'll do 20 years in
Leavenworth for looting.

79
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.159
Hey. What'd I tell you?
We are not looters.

80
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.880
We are liberators of
precious antiquities.

81
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.216
Liberators of
precious antiquities.

82
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240
Right.
Right.

83
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.920
But we don't even
know what's down there.

84
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.476
Haram. Haram is what's
down there. Treasure.

85
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.036
No, the translator said
"haram" means "forbidden knowledge."

86
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160
Like a curse.

87
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.515
Around here, that's just
another word for "treasure,"

88
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.950
and this guy, this Henry guy,
he seems to want it pretty bad.

89
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.839
Well, now he's gonna
have to pay double.

90
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.760
Mount up. No, sir, I
ain't going on this one.

91
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.034
What?
I'm not going.

92
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120
Vail.

93
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.440
What are you gonna do,
stab me with that?

94
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.832
Oh, no, no, no!

95
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.154
You crazy bastard.

96
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.835
It's a full day's ride
to the nearest water!

97
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.395
The nearest water
is right down in that village.

98
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.195
Come on, Vail.

99
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.032
Where's your
sense of adventure?

100
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.715
Well, that's just great, Nick.
That's just great!

101
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.190
Come on, slip in, slip out,
just like we always do.

102
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.754
You son of a bitch!

103
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840
Oh, my God!

104
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.632
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

105
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.759
Move! Move!

106
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.717
Just run! Run, run!

107
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.600
Go, go, go!

108
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.559
You kidding me?

109
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.273
"Slip in, slip out"?

110
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.918
This is not like
we always do!

111
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.559
Stairs! Just run! Run!

112
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200
Run, run, run!

113
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.760
Grenade!

114
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.318
I hate you!
I hate you so much!

115
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.199
I never even wanted to
come to this country!

116
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.231
Let me think.
Just let me think.

117
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.153
If anyone is listening,
this is L-26, urgent, hot!

118
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.193
Request dynamic precision
strike at our mark!

119
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.914
You did not just
call in an airstrike!

120
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.116
Oh, yes, I did!

121
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.038
Where are you going?
Don't leave me!

122
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.832
Where do they
keep coming from?

123
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.959
There's nowhere to go!

124
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.879
Oh, man!
We're gonna die!

125
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.632
Just, please, Vail!
Let me think!

126
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.030
We're gonna die because of you!
Just let me think!

127
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.270
Think about what?
Think about what?

128
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.835
I'm thinking...

129
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960
What?

130
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.879
I'm thinking...

131
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.919
What are you thinking?

132
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.632
I'm thinking we're
probably gonna die here.

133
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.434
I knew it!

134
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640
I knew it!

135
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.509
Huh?

136
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.110
I am still alive!

137
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560
No!

138
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.394
Nick! Nick!

139
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.069
Haram.

140
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
Sir!

141
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.511
I was told you boys were supposed
to be 100 klicks from here!

142
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600
Yes, sir!

143
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.159
But based
on intelligence,

144
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.151
we had reason to
believe the insurgents

145
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.191
were holding civilian hostages.

146
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.511
We had to make a call, wait for
Delta to respond or go in alone!

147
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.576
It was Sergeant Morton's
idea to go in, actually!

148
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.635
Uh-huh.

149
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.280
Only to find out that the villagers
had long since evacuated.

150
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.839
Yeah, lucky for them,
not for us.

151
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.512
Delta, south-side
perimeter.

152
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.478
Sir,
when we realized

153
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.520
we were in the center of
the insurgent stronghold,

154
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.675
it was too late.

155
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.433
We were discovered,
we started taking on heavy fire.

156
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.517
Well, sir,
Corporal Vail, here,

157
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.272
is too humble
to admit it,

158
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.033
but he risked his
life to save mine.

159
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.634
He's a hero. In fact, I'd
like to recommend him

160
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.948

161
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.751
Let me run another
scenario by you.

162
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840
Sir?

163
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.754
One in which two assholes from
long-range reconnaissance,

164
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.108
that would be you,

165
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.590
run all over northern Iraq just
one step ahead of the enemy.

166
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.196
Except, instead of hunting for the enemy,
you hunt for antiquities,

167
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.350
stealing whatever
isn't nailed down

168
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.550
and selling it on
the black market.

169
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.870
Meanwhile,
these fanatical insurgents

170
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.110
trying to erase
5,000 years of history

171
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.477
unwittingly cover your tracks.
It's a pretty good scam.

172
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.680
Sergeant Morton!

173
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.439
Where is it?

174
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.357
What? Where's what?

175
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.313
The letter, the map
you stole from me.

176
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640
Map?

177
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.096
I don't know what
you're talking about.

178
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.917
How would I have
even had an opportunity

179
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.837
to steal anything
from you, Miss...

180
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.754
Miss...

181
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.816
Okay.
Sergeant Morton,

182
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.717
here, thinks that I'll
be too embarrassed

183
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.519
to tell you that I had
him in my hotel room

184
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.238
three nights ago
in Baghdad.

185
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.153
And whilst I was sleeping,
he went through my things.

186
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.629
I'm not embarrassed, Nick.

187
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.068
Disgusted, yes.

188
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.991
Regretful? Certainly.

189
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.997
But mainly,
just amazed at your ability

190
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.152
to mimic all the qualities
of genuine human intimacy

191
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.919
if only for 15 seconds.

192
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.838
Where's the map, Morton?

193
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.839
Okay. Sir, I admit

194
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.399
that Miss Halsey
and I did spend

195
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.920
a delightful
evening in Baghdad.

196
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.520
A very long and
satisfying evening,

197
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.068
if her reactions are to
be considered sincere.

198
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.176
But, sir, I left with nothing
more than fond memories.

199
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.872
Now, perhaps I may
have neglected

200
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.598
to say goodbye to
her the next morning,

201
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.557
only because
she was exhausted

202
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.272
and I didn't wanna wake her.
Okay.

203
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.430
And the reward for my
gracious consideration?

204
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.672
Well, sir, as you can see,
hell hath no fury. Hmm.

205
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.353
- Sir.
- Oh, my God!

206
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.269
It's Egyptian.

207
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.078
Oh, is that
unusual?

208
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.793
We're in the Persian
Gulf, Vail.

209
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.792
Right, Egypt's 1,000 miles away,
so it's unusual.

210
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.916
Put those down, hurry.
Go get the rest.

211
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.035
Got it.

212
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.392
Colonel,
this is a significant find.

213
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.312
I need your men to
secure this village.

214
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.152
We're not even
supposed to be here.

215
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.160
It is my job to make sure
that anything of value

216
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.434
stays out of enemy hands.

217
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.597
We have no idea what
could be down there.

218
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.235
The contents of
Tutankhamun's tomb alone

219
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.357
were valued at 650
million pounds sterling.

220
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.754
Understand?

221
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.554
Oh. Um...

222
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.278
Colonel? If I may.

223
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.056
With a couple of shaped charges, we
could just close this hole right up

224
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.720
and Miss Halsey can
come back another day.

225
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.630
Shut up.
Okay.

226
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.591
You got two hours,
then we're moving out.

227
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.392
You're getting in the
hole with her. Him?

228
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.959
Me?
Yep.

229
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.268
Sir...

230
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.549
You gear up.
That's an order.

231
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.360
I'll be right here
holding the rope, Sarge.

232
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.600
Get in the damn
hole, Vail!

233
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.789
Oh, man!

234
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.279
I'm in a large
antechamber of some kind.

235
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.349
There is an inscription
on the northern wall,

236
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.600
the Litany of Ra.

237
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.318
Are you kidding me?

238
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.276
Your fault, Nick.
Your fault.

239
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.216
Do you see any treasure
in here, Nick? 'Cause I don't.

240
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.629
You know what I see? I see
statues that I can't carry out.

241
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.876
Just keep it down.
You keep it down.

242
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.120
What are you doing?

243
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.273
It is definitely a tomb.

244
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.593
What is that? Mercury?

245
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.040
Yeah.

246
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.512
The ancient Egyptians believed
it weakened evil spirits.

247
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.630
Well, now we know better.
Stuff will kill you.

248
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.193
Yeah, after it makes
you crazy.

249
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.277
There is mercury dripping from
the ceiling into holes in the ground.

250
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.358
Possibly interconnected.

251
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.351
It's a canal system
leading all the way to...

252
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.194
Get the lights!

253
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.397
Oh, my God.

254
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.359
Get everything
out of the bags.

255
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.514
What did I tell you?

256
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.398
That's a
lot of gold, Nick.

257
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.593
I'm in a large, man-made cavern
adjoining the antechamber.

258
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.359
There are chiseled stairs
descending from the ledge.

259
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.152
There is a canal at
the center of them

260
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.358
that feeds a ritual well at the
base, filled with mercury.

261
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.675
Pleated skirts,
scarab signet rings.

262
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.796
This is a High Priest of Amun
from the temple in Thebes.

263
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.429
There is a ritual barrier
chain that surrounds the well

264
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.918
as a warning to intruders.

265
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.229
To keep people out.

266
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.592
There isn't
a single provision

267
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.314
made for someone's journey
into the underworld.

268
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.630
No canopic jars, no shabtis.

269
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.431
To be buried in
a place like this

270
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.312
would have been
a fate worse than death.

271
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Nick!

272
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.552
Don't even think about it.

273
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.835
There are six
watchers around the well

274
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.038
facing inward
instead of out.

275
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.799
Whatever's in there, those chains
aren't for bringing it up.

276
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.752
They're for holding
it down.

277
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.358
This is not a tomb.

278
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.029
It's a prison.

279
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.360
<i>Lima 2-6, come in.</i>

280
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.840
Copy, sir.

281
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.275
<i>Get out now. We got reports
of bogeys inbound.</i>

282
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.588
<i>We gotta take off.</i>

283
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.950
Tell Greenway we
have to notify DTRA.

284
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.359
For what?
I need specialists

285
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.475
- from Cairo...
- Cairo?

286
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.856
...CBRN suits,
and shielding casks.

287
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.836
Jenny,
we are out of time.

288
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.558
You better grab
what you can now!

289
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.816
I am not leaving until
I see what's in that pool.

290
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.990
You're leaving.
We're leaving right now.

291
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.310
I did not come this
far just to leave with...

292
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.959
Oh!

293
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.712
Ahh! Ow!

294
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.268
Hey! Hey!

295
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.033
Cease fire! Vail!

296
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.509
Vail, cease fire!
Cease fire!

297
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.990
They're just camel spiders!
They're not even poisonous!

298
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.832
Can we please leave?

299
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.831
Are you out of your mind, Vail?
Please!

300
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.951
What is wrong with you?
The thing bit me, Nick!

301
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.951
Okay, okay.
It bit me!

302
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.078
Enough of this! I don't care!

303
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.191
I'm leaving! With or
without you, I'm leaving!

304
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.157
It bit me! Please, Nick!

305
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.714
<i>Nick!</i>

306
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.069
<i>Nick!</i>

307
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.514
Nick!

308
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.153
Tell Greenway he's
gonna send a team

309
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.400
to get this thing
out of here,

310
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.314
or he's gonna have to explain
why he left me behind.

311
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.829
Do it!

312
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560
Okay.

313
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.114
Guidelines are manned!

314
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.336
<i>Guideline is steady.</i>

315
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.032
Move more to
your 9 o'clock!

316
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.110
<i>Holding at 30 feet.</i>

317
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.599
A little more.

318
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.434
<i>Three-eight-Sierra-
four-two-seven-niner-point-six-six-nine.</i>

319
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.589
<i>Go to the MSR, grid two-five-seven-

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.033
<i>Bishop to Echo,</i>

321
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.033
<i>we have visual on a severe sandstorm
heading west at angels 12.</i>

322
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.800
Hey!

323
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.040
Hey!

324
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.673
Wait, wait,
please be careful.

325
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.988
This is 5,000
years old.

326
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.668
Sixty seconds!
In the air! Let's go!

327
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.828
Carefully.
Very, very carefully.

328
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.256
Get us off the ground now!

329
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.952
Halsey, take a seat!

330
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.400
Need some help?

331
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.555
No.

332
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.716
You're welcome, by the way.
How's that?

333
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.314
Because I saved
your whatever-it-is.

334
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.791
That was safely
hidden for 5,000 years

335
00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.911
before you dropped a
Hellfire missile on it.

336
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.037
And you might never have
found it otherwise.

337
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.398
Again, you're welcome.

338
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.589
Do you have any
idea what this is?

339
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.318
The significance of it?

340
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.155
An Egyptian sarcophagus
in a tomb in Mesopotamia.

341
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.759
Why'd you say
15 seconds?

342
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.995
Why'd I what?

343
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.272
You told Greenway
that I could mimic

344
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.192
all the qualities
of human intimacy

345
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.793
for 15 seconds.

346
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.997
I mean, let me tell you,
it was not 15 seconds.

347
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.273
Well, however long it lasted,
it wasn't real.

348
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.915
I never lied to you
about my feelings.

349
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.792
You stole from me.

350
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.073
But I didn't lie.

351
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.998
Do you ever think of
anyone but yourself?

352
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.628
This means something.

353
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.752
Something bigger
than you can imagine.

354
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.279
My life's work.

355
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.396
And you were
going to steal it.

356
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.994
How much do you figure that's
worth on the black market?

357
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.239
This is Dr. Jennifer Halsey
conducting a preliminary analysis

358
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.117
of an Egyptian sarcophagus

359
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.909
discovered in the Nineveh
province, northern Iraq.

360
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.397
The hieroglyphs are
definitely New Kingdom.

361
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.953
It appears that
the wife of King Menehptre

362
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.675
died in childbirth,

363
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.792
leaving a sole
heir to the throne,

364
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.558
a girl

365
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.956
called Ahmanet.

366
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.679
Corporal, what in
the living hell are you doing, son?

367
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.629
Vail?

368
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.760
Corporal Vail?

369
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.314
Damn it.

370
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.760
Corporal Vail, do you hear me
talking to you? I said what...

371
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.596
Vail, just...

372
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.200
Vail! Whoa, whoa!

373
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.798
Vail!
Oh, my God. Vail!

374
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.216
- Drop your weapon!
- Put it down!

375
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.992
Drop it now!
Please! No, don't!

376
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.076
Drop it, now!

377
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.680
- Put the gun down!
- Drop it!

378
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.840
- Put down the weapon! Put it down! Back off!
- Wait, wait.

379
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.880
Stop! Do not shoot!

380
00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.592
This is a pressurized
aircraft! Nick.

381
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.640
What...

382
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.034
Vail.

383
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.398
Vail, put the knife down.
Vail. Vail. Vail.

384
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.896
- Vail, no. No, no!
- Vail! Vail! Vail!

385
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.069
Vail! Vail!

386
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.588
Okay, Vail, stop.
Stop! Vail, Vail, Vail!

387
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.108
I'm sorry.

388
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.914
Pan, Pan, Pan!

389
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.797
This is November
four-zero-niner-niner,

390
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.256
United States C-130 Hercules
inbound 6 miles off the coast...

391
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.111
What's happening?
Take your seat and strap in.

392
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.150
...of Dover, England.
England?

393
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.696
Ma'am, I don't
know what's happening.

394
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.720
Take a seat!

395
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.520
We lost thrust
in both engines.

396
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.470
No radar contact.

397
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.120
Dropping to 12,000,
280 on the heading.

398
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.991
What the hell is that?

399
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600
Go, go, go!

400
00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.634
Parachute!

401
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.314
Parachute!

402
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.590
I don't know
how to do this!

403
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.796
Jenny, Jenny, you can do this.
You can do this.

404
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.195
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

405
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.376
<i>It's an awful thing
to have to ask, I know.</i>

406
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.992
It's most irregular.

407
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.549
Noted, Doctor.
Thank you.

408
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.515
We'll let Miss
Halsey decide.

409
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.199
Miss Halsey?

410
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.796
Miss Halsey, do you
think you're up to it?

411
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.073
I'm sorry, what?

412
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.993
We need your help
identifying the bodies.

413
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.514
Whoa!

414
00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.795
Vail!

415
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.839
Hey, buddy.

416
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.197
You scared
the shit out of me.

417
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.674
We need to talk, Nick.

418
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.071
What's...
What's happening?

419
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.039
You know
what's happening.

420
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.271
Am I dead?

421
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.469
Dead?

422
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.549
No, but you're
gonna wish you were.

423
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.319
Right this way,
please.

424
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.353
- Oh, my God! Nick.
- Oh!

425
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.471
Jen... Oh!

426
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.437
What's happening?
Where am I?

427
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.714
Who's in charge here?

428
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.720
Uh...

429
00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.136

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.828
Pier's a wreck.

435
00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.150
Looks like part of the wing.
A turbine.

436
00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.880
Miles away from

444
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.550

still alight, but no immediate

<i>A United States military plane</i>

How did you get
out of that plane?

458
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.189
There's not a single
scratch on your body.

459
00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.196
Yeah.

460
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.228
Thank you.

461
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.428
For what?

462
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.239
You saved my life.

463
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.076
You'd have done
the same for me.

465
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.069

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.120
Listen, Nick.

467
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.394
I...

468
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.073
I think you
should know something.

469
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.833
You know I work with
a group of archaeologists.

470
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.189
Yeah.
Well,

471
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.793
we've developed
this theory

472
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.839
that an Egyptian princess had been
erased from the history books

473
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.349
deliberately.

474
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.070
We've been searching for something
called the Dagger of Set.

475
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.231
<i>A ceremonial knife with a
large jewel at the hilt.</i>

476
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.910
<i>Set is the Egyptian
god of death.</i>

477
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.029
And legend has it that the
dagger and the stone, together,

478
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.512
had the power to
give Set physical form.

479
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.709
I'm convinced it was
hidden here in Europe.

480
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.350
Stolen by Crusaders
centuries ago.

481
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.510
I found reference to it in a manuscript
written by a Crusader knight

482
00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.189
<i>that suggested the dagger
was broken apart.</i>

483
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.395
<i>That the stone was buried with this
knight somewhere here in England.</i>

484
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.953
<i>A massive Crusader tomb was
recently discovered under London.</i>

485
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.077
<i>We believe that the stone
is in there somewhere.</i>

486
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.637
<i>That tomb is what
led us to Ahmanet.</i>

487
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.995
I think she's the
princess in the legend.

488
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.389
The hieroglyphs said
she murdered her father.

489
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.915
Murdered?
Along with his child.

490
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.591
She made some sort of pact
with the god of death.

491
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.279
And then, when I
saw those birds,

492
00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.240
and that sandstorm... You know, I mean...
Something is happening.

493
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.115
You're alive and
I don't know how.

494
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.872
You. Me. Go.

495
00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.232
I'm sorry, Nick. I think
we've angered the gods.

496
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.513
Would you excuse me?

497
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.318
I'll be right back.

498
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.936
<i>Identify, please.</i>

499
00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.080
This is Jenny. Get me Henry.

500
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Jennifer.

501
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.516
This is a far more significant
problem than we had ever imagined.

502
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.115
<i>Something is happening, Henry.
I'm worried about him.</i>

503
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.872
Bring your soldier to London.

504
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.996
Do not discuss
anything further with him.

505
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.399
<i>Understand?</i>

506
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.634
What are you doing here?

507
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.800
Jenny looks good.

508
00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.800
Okay, this isn't happening.
I mean, really great.

509
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.995
Okay, really. Stop.

510
00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.776
You know, I always thought
I had a chance with her.

511
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.756
What?
How do you squander that?

512
00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.656
There was mercury in that tomb.
The vapors were toxic.

513
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.920
I mean,
how do you mess that up?

514
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.036
It's just in my head,
it's in my head.

515
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.718
No, it's not.

516
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.548
You shot me.

517
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.471
Wait, wait. Wait,
wait, wait. You... You...

518
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.155
You

519
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.999
stabbed Greenway.

520
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.877
I saved you...
You murdered him.

521
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
...and you shot me.

522
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.192
You tried to kill me.
You even went after Jenny.

523
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.595
You shot me. Three times.

524
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.037
Yes.
Three times, Nick.

525
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.837
Okay, the third
one was unnecessary.

526
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.596
You freaked me out,
I panicked.

527
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.755
I'm sorry. Okay?
Not okay.

528
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.996
Look at me. Look at my face.

529
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.991
I'm cursed, Nick.
And you're cursed.

530
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.276
And there's only
one way to break it.

531
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.113
You are going to do
exactly what she wants,

532
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.118
or this is gonna get a lot
worse for both of us.

533
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.874
What do you mean, I'm cursed?

534
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240
I'm sorry.

535
00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.390
Just give me a minute.
Thank you.

536
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.556
You walked into the chicks'
bathroom, by the way.

537
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.816
Go to your
own sodding loo!

538
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.656
- Yeah, it's a ladies' room.
- We just want to pee!

539
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.856
What do you mean,
I'm cursed?

540
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.518
How do you think you
survived the crash?

541
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.553
Setepa-i.

542
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.176
- Bloody Yanks. Unbelievable.
- Yeah!

543
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.077
You know
what it means.

544
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.272
She's got plans
for you, Nick.

545
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.436
Plans?
You can't run.

546
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.795
You can't escape.

547
00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.429
Help me!

548
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.348
Help me!

549
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.876
Setepa-i!

550
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.476
Out of the road, wanker!

551
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.875
Nick! What the hell
are you doing?

552
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.154
Okay, you were right.

553
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.748
We've angered the gods.
Wait, what?

554
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.354
I saw her.
The chick in the box.

555
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.629
Ahmanet?
That one.

556
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.039
Nick...
He said I'm cursed.

557
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200
Who said?
Vail.

558
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.509
Vail?
The coffin we found.

559
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760
Sarcophagus.
Whatever.

560
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.990
There was writing on it.
Hieroglyphics.

561
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.991
Jenny, respectfully,
I'm not interested

562
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.832
in archaeological
jargon right now.

563
00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.832
The writing on the box that
we took out of the hole.

564
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.030
Yes, sorry.

565
00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.400
There was something about a
curse on there, wasn't there?

566
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.789
Nick, you've had
a concussion.

567
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.558
Yes.
Toxic exposure.

568
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.756
How does that
explain that I know

569
00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.950
that Setepa-i
means "my chosen"?

570
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.200
That's ancient Egyptian.
Ancient Egyptian.

571
00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.230
How do I know that?

572
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.656
You've been in the
Middle East for years.

573
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.318
What? No! You heard
it, you forgot it.

574
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.960
Why are you backing off from this?
I'm telling you.

575
00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.109
She is real.

576
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.075
Nick.

577
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.473
Nick, what is it?

578
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.313
I think you're right.
I...

579
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.753
I think this is
all in my head.

580
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.272
We should find the box,
look inside,

581
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.595
and when I see a 3,000-year-old
prune in there...

582
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.398
Nick.
...no more curse.

583
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.516
You don't need a sarcophagus,
you need a doctor.

584
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.908
I know someone.

585
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.714
A specialist in London.

586
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.390
Don't tell me that you
don't wanna see it, too.

587
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.794
Your life's work.

588
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.279
Come on, Jenny.

589
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.436
I think I know
where it is.

590
00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.635
<i>Charlie 8-1.
Charlie 8-1 to Base.</i>

591
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.230
<i>We are at the main crash site,
400 meters north of Waverley Abbey.</i>

592
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.029
<i>Firefighters are containing the
wreckage, but the site is still hot.</i>

593
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.995
Nick.

594
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.828
Nick! Where are
you going?

595
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.936
The crash site is up that way.
Where are you going?

596
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.190
No. We're in
the right place.

597
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.755
Nick.

598
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.233
Nick!

599
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.231
I don't know what
we're doing here.

600
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.675
This isn't
the right place.

601
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.432
Yes, it is.

602
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.272
No, it isn't.

603
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.239
The main crash site is up that
way, and so is my artifact.

604
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.594
And that's where
we're going.

605
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.917
Setepa-i.

606
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.833
What the hell?

607
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.795
How did I...

608
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.515
Jenny?

609
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.235
Okay.

610
00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.035
Nick?

611
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.600
Ah...

612
00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.395
Okay.

613
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.715
Okay.

614
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.875
No, seriously...

615
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.040
What?

616
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.952
I'm sorry, what?

617
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.269
Oh, God.

618
00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.155
No, no, no.

619
00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.560
No, please.

620
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.355
Jenny!

621
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800
Yeah?

622
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.991
Run! Run!

623
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.840
Ugh!

624
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.709
Come on!
Come on!

625
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.997
Nick! Nick!

626
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.075
Nick!

627
00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.914
Hey! Hey!

628
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.231
No, no, no! Hey!

629
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.510
Hey! Nick! Stop!

630
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.680
Nick!

631
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.514
Were you just gonna
leave me?

632
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.716
You saw that, right?
You were gonna leave me!

633
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.598
You saw it, right?
I can't unsee it!

634
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.560
Where are we going?

635
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.909
Away from here. There's
a highway up ahead.

636
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.399
How do you know?
I know.

637
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.075
Oh, my God. Do you
realize what this is?

638
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.360
It's the Dagger of Set.

639
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.550
She was gonna drive that
thing right through me.

640
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.551
The stone,
it is missing.

641
00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.352
Yeah, that seemed to
really piss her off.

642
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.959
It's real.

643
00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.439
How was it in a statue?

644
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.717
That statue was
a reliquary.

645
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.673
Crusaders would use them
to hide holy relics.

646
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.319
But she knew
it was there.

647
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.033
What... You're saying that she
brought the plane down there?

648
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.155
On purpose?

649
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.160
That's why she wanted you
to come to the church.

650
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.416
She wanted me to
go to the church?

651
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.954
I told you that I wanted
to go to the church.

652
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.514
I told you,
I said I wanted to see...

653
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.831
I wanted to see her corpse.
See her corpse.

654
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.273
Nick, she's in
your head.

655
00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.273
What are you talking about?
That is ridiculous. Because I...

656
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.353
I drove
right back to her.

657
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.118
Oh, my God,
she's in my head.

658
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.837
Go, go, go!

659
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.833
Get it off me!

660
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.479
Son of a bitch!

661
00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.511
That's my face! That's my face!
That's my face!

662
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.669
Sorry!

663
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.920
Nick!

664
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.115
Nick!

665
00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.389
Jenny?

666
00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.437
Jenny. Jenny.

667
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.874
Nick! Nick!

668
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.115
Okay.

669
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.429
All right.

670
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.600
Get her, Nick!

671
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.113
Get her! Get her!

672
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.520
Kick her ass!

673
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.480
Route is clear. Come on!

674
00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.041
That's it, pull her back tight!

675
00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.592
Delta Team, move!

676
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.028
Bring target down!

677
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.435
Clear!

678
00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.795
Who are you...

679
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.029
Where are you taking me?

680
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.589
What's happening?

681
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.869
Stay.

682
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.398
Make yourself comfortable.

683
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.233
Who the hell are you?

684
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.148
Who am I?

685
00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.435
The more relevant question,
Mr. Morton,

686
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.158
is who exactly are you?

687
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.029
In theory,
I know all about you.

688
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.678
Army reconnaissance,
decorated soldier,

689
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.469
and page after page indicating a
deep and troubling moral turpitude.

690
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.919
But, you see,
this file contains

691
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.399
nothing of any
real value to me.

692
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.471
That's why I wanted to
see you face-to-face.

693
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.439
Who are you?

694
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.999
I'm a doctor.

695
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.115
A doctor.

696
00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.517
Chemical pathology,
neurosurgery.

697
00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.431
Fellow of the Royal Society.

698
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.279
I'm also a lawyer.

699
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.674
My name is Jekyll.

700
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.079
Dr. Henry Jekyll.

701
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.149
There you are.

702
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.474
These days,
I specialize in immunology, perhaps.

703
00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.675
Infectious disease, perhaps.

704
00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.399
I would like, if I may,
Mr. Morton,

705
00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.792
to tell you a story.

706
00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.552
A story about
a patient of mine.

707
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.471
A man of promise.

708
00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.990
A man who believed
he was beyond reproach

709
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.156
until he got ill.

710
00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.037
The disease manifested itself
in subtle ways, at first.

711
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.511
And then it grew

712
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:50.798
into an overwhelming desire,
an unquenchable thirst...

713
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.760
...for chaos.

714
00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.994
For the suffering of others.

715
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.399
He was quite fortunate.

716
01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.749
He himself
was a physician.

717
01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.274
And if evil were a pathogen,
he reasoned,

718
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.868
then there must
surely be a cure.

719
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.758
I would like, if I may,
Mr. Morton,

720
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.557
to show you something.

721
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.673
Welcome to Prodigium,
Mr. Morton.

722
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.029
From the Latin,
monstrum vel prodigium.

723
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.350
"A warning of monsters."

724
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.429
Forgive the state of things.

725
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.795
We had very little time
to prepare for our guest

726
01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.920
and only the information
Jennifer provided to go on.

727
01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.910
In truth,
she works for us.

728
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.871
It's not an exact science,
this business.

729
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.720
What?

730
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.277
And the business being?

731
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.270
Evil, Mr. Morton.

732
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.557
Recognize, contain,
examine, destroy.

733
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.437
She is by far the most ancient
we've ever encountered.

734
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.829
What are you doing to her?

735
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.596
Embalming her
with mercury.

736
01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.993
At minus 38 degrees

737
01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.310
the mercury in her veins
will solidify,

738
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.670
and she should be
safe for dissection then.

739
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.558
Dissection?
You said that we'd study her.

740
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.836
Yes, by dissection.

741
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.918
But she's a living witness to a
history that we barely know.

742
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.176
She's a threat, Jennifer.

743
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.475
Hold on, hold on.
So, where does that leave me?

744
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.351
Cursed, Mr. Morton.

745
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.755
This is not some
common cold you have.

746
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.310
Some chicken soup and a good night's
sleep will not make it go away.

747
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.397
You have been selected as the
vessel for the ultimate evil.

748
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.479
And we are the only ones
who can rectify that.

749
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200
No.

750
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.191
<i>I was going to give him</i>

751
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.552
<i>eternal life.</i>

752
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.389
Make him a living god.

753
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.879
You murdered your father.

754
01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.033
<i>I loved my father</i>

755
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.431
<i>with all my heart.</i>

756
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.273
I only wanted
his love in return.

757
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.469
You killed his wife.

758
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.349
<i>Their child.</i>

759
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.750
They were different times.

760
01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.316
The Day of Awakening
will soon be upon us.

761
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.078
You will become Set.

762
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.834
<i>The world will
fall to your desire.</i>

763
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.113
<i>You will have power
of life over death.</i>

764
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.792
<i>And you will have me.</i>

765
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.798
<i>I will be your queen.</i>

766
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.468
<i>Just give in.</i>

767
01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.755
<i>Nick.</i>

768
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.749
Nick. Wake up.

769
01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.239
Wake up.

770
01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.676
They will kill you, just as they
killed my chosen before you.

771
01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.593
It burns.

772
01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.629
What?

773
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.193
It burns!

774
01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.989
Stop it!

775
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160
Stop it! Stop!

776
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.669
Stop!

777
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.038
Stop it!

778
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.309
Stop!

779
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.633
Fascinating.

780
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.355
What was I
supposed to tell you?

781
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.276
Would you even
have believed me

782
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.391
if I'd said this
place was real?

783
01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.229
When Henry came to me,

784
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.193
I took the job because
we had a common interest.

785
01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.956
So, you're using
each other.

786
01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.271
Now she's using you.

787
01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.155
Look.

788
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.795
Despite what
you might think,

789
01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.073
despite my...

790
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.918
My better judgment,

791
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.872
I care about you.

792
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.273
Somewhere in there,
fighting to get out,

793
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.073
is a good man.

794
01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.872
You don't know that.

795
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.709
I do.

796
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.153
How?

797
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.829
You saved my life
on that plane.

798
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.716
You gave me the only parachute
without hesitation.

799
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.039
I thought
there was another one.

800
01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.511
Mr. Morton.

801
01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.229
Drink?

802
01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.637
I think
I've found something.

803
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.359
The "old" gods?

804
01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.751
Your language is simple.

805
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.591
What you truly wish
to know is

806
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.749
what lies beyond
the veil of death.

807
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.517
To know what I have seen?

808
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.469
Yes.

809
01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.878
And you will,

810
01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.993
when I

811
01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.638
kill you.

812
01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.073
They have found the stone.

813
01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.358
You brought my chosen here.

814
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.236
What do you think
they will do with him now?

815
01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.320
Huh.

816
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.393
Welcome to a new world
of gods and monsters.

817
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.511
Evil has many names,
Mr. Morton. Mmm.

818
01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.718
Take Set, for example.

819
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.554
Known to Egyptians
as the god of death.

820
01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.156
Mmm. In the Old Testament,
Satan, Lucifer.

821
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.958
The devil.
Quite so.

822
01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.712
Yeah. Bad... Badness.
Got it.

823
01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.637
So, you see,
evil is the shadow

824
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.075
that exists just outside our world...
Uh-huh.

825
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.590
...continuously searching
for a way to come in.

826
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.640
<i>For a way to
become flesh and blood.</i>

827
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.791
Either we wait
for that day to arrive,

828
01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.359
or we can fight it
on our own terms.

829
01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.353
Which brings me to you.

830
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.590
Me? Yeah, great.
Yes, Doc.

831
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.437
You said you could cure me of this curse.
Get rid of it.

832
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.556
So, let's do it, Doc.

833
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.793
What's your plan?

834
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.794
Mr. Morton,
these things are complex.

835
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.274
Yeah. I bet, I bet.

836
01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.998
When one is dealing with
the salvation of humanity,

837
01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.394
certain sacrifices
must be made.

838
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.794
Excuse me, sir.

839
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.949
They found it.

840
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.433
Found what?

841
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.835
Henry.

842
01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.639
Are you planning
on killing him?

843
01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.800
Kill?

844
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.319
Jennifer...
Kill who?

845
01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.153
Mr. Morton, here,
essentially killed himself

846
01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.158
when he severed
the barrier chain

847
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.754
that had kept Ahmanet's power
imprisoned for 5,000 years.

848
01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.030
He was chosen
as her ideal candidate.

849
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.791
A thief, physically capable,
compulsively devious,

850
01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.319
and utterly devoid of soul.

851
01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.714
What?
What?

852
01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.830
That's insane.

853
01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.434
You want to put the stone in the
dagger and stab him with it?

854
01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.478
Well, the dagger will allow
Set to enter his body,

855
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.949
and then, we obliterate it.

856
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:08.990
Wait, wait, wait.

857
01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.752
You wanna stab me
with that thing?

858
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.989
Intentionally?

859
01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.515
Precisely what the Egyptians
should have done.

860
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.033
<i>You see, they interrupted
a ritual in process,</i>

861
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.873
and that is a mistake
we cannot...

862
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.392
...afford to repeat.

863
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200
What?

864
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.753
That's the plan?

865
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.280
Henry,
you can't possibly do this.

866
01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240
That's your plan?

867
01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.914
<i>The dominoes
are already falling.</i>

868
01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.513
<i>We haven't much time.</i>

869
01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.030
Unfortunately,
it is a risk we must take.

870
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.879
That's really your plan?

871
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.638
You heard Ahmanet.

872
01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.234
Your curse cannot be broken.

873
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.719
I am truly sorry, Mr. Morton.

874
01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.714
No matter what I do,
you are going to die.

875
01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.314
<i>Yes, evil is a disease.</i>

876
01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.315
<i>A pestilent,
pustulant infection</i>

877
01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.715
<i>burrowing its way
into our souls.</i>

878
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.595
<i>The world needs a cure.</i>

879
01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.070
You can be that cure.
Stop.

880
01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.696
A sacrifice for the greater good!
Just stop.

881
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.312
I'm not interested
in that at all.

882
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.351
Okay.

883
01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.560
Don't!
Give me the injector.

884
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.896
Okay, we're just
gonna take a minute,

885
01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.911
and we're all gonna
come up with a new plan.

886
01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.896
We have to go. You don't
know what you're doing.

887
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.400
Really? I know
exactly what I'm doing.

888
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.856
Oh, my dear Henry Jekyll,

889
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.440
if ever I've seen Satan's
signature upon a face,

890
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.111
it is on that of
your new friend.

891
01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.278
Okay, hey, hey, hey!
Take it!

892
01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.509
Now!

893
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.278
Run, Mr. Morton.
What?

894
01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.839
Run!

895
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.115
Nick! Open the door!

896
01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.275
You don't want that.

897
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.319
Stop! Jenny!

898
01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.595
Stop!

899
01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.677
They won't
let me out, Nicholas.

900
01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.988
They never do.

901
01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

902
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.390
What's happening?

903
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.840
Did you just shut
down the mercury?

904
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.349
Pete?

905
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

906
01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.836
You are a younger man,

907
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.520
but you'd best learn to be
wary of a man like me.

908
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.309
It's not me that wants
to kill you, it's Henry.

909
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.555
I have something more
collaborative in mind.

910
01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.360
Oh, nice.

911
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.518
I'm offering
you a partnership.

912
01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.193
You, Evil Incarnate.

913
01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.998
Me, your good friend,
Eddie Hyde.

914
01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.195
Think about it.

915
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.029
Jenny!

916
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.029
Oh, come on.

917
01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.039
Jenny, stop!

918
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.319
Come on, son.
Think about it.

919
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.755
Mayhem, chaos, destruction.

920
01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.234
The ladies will love us.

921
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880
Come here.

922
01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.109
I do enjoy
the countenance of pain.

923
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.428
Well done, Mr. Morton. Well done.

924
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.515
Come on. We have to
destroy the stone.

925
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.750
What?
No stone, no ritual.

926
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.840
No ritual...

927
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.513
No curse.
Yes.

928
01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.868
I know where it is.

929
01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.560
Nick! Nick!

930
01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.836
Just wait, wait.
Which way out?

931
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.035
I don't know.

932
01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.315
Hello?

933
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.955
She's out! She has the dagger.

934
01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.752
We think she's coming to you.
So are we.

935
01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.634
<i>Lock your doors
and secure that stone.</i>

936
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.513
Nick! Nick!

937
01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.829
Let's go!

938
01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.393
I know where the stone is!

939
01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.755
Let's go!

940
01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.638
Wow, that was intense!

941
01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.792
Okay, follow me.

942
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.296
<i>We're heading
to the Crusader burial chamber.</i>

943
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.517
<i>We'll make our entry through the
northwest train tunnels. Over.</i>

944
01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.758
This is the moment, Nick.

945
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.558
This is the moment!

946
01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.034
Yeah, you're damn right.

947
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.760
I'm gonna take you to that stone,
deliver you to Ahmanet,

948
01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.275
then my work here is done.

949
01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.029
What?

950
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.435
Nick?

951
01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.555
Jenny?

952
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.600
Hey, buddy.

953
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.994
Ahmanet is never
going to let her live.

954
01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.479
You can't save her.

955
01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.832
Oh, no! Move!

956
01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.589
Nick?

957
01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.715
Nick?

958
01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.275
Nick?

959
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.310
You shouldn't be here.
I followed you!

960
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.155
Go, go, go!

961
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.237
Are you okay? Are you okay?

962
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.753
Where are we?
I don't know.

963
01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.394
I don't know.

964
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.959
Are you okay?

965
01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.837
I'm scared.
Just look at me.

966
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.672
We're gonna figure this out.
Just...

967
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.950
You just stay with me, please.

968
01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.073
We're gonna figure this out.
Okay? You just stay with me.

969
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.353
Just stay with me.
We'll figure this out.

970
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.600
Okay, it's gonna be okay...

971
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.558
Ah! No! Jenny!

972
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.511
Jenny! No! No!

973
01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.908
Don't!

974
01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.399
Let go!

975
01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.720
Jenny!

976
01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.276
Jenny! Jenny!

977
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.877
No!

978
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.198
Don't blame yourself.

979
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.876
She was always doomed.

980
01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.871
There are worse fates
than death.

981
01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.279
Come to me.

982
01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.039
It hurts.

983
01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.874
I know.

984
01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.873
Let me take the pain away.

985
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.159
Give in to me.

986
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.760
Oh. Uh...

987
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.959
Give in.

988
01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.751
Give in.

989
01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.313
When it's over,

990
01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.711
you will thank me.

991
01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.672
I promise.

992
01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.239
I'm sorry.

993
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.911
We're just
never gonna happen.

994
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.033
And it's not me.

995
01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.114
It's you.

996
01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.278
Thief.

997
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.319
Wait!

998
01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.311
Destroy the stone
and all is lost.

999
01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.679
You will be a living god.

1000
01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.957
You will have power
of life over death.

1001
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.439
Give it to me,

1002
01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.793
my chosen.

1003
01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.031
Give it to me,

1004
01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.113
my love.

1005
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.709
Setepa-i.

1006
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.798
Somewhere in there,
I know you're a good man.

1007
01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.278
<i>The world needs a cure.</i>

1008
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.833
You can be that cure.

1009
01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.796
A sacrifice for
the greater good!

1010
01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.988
Jenny.

1011
01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.553
Wake up, wake up.

1012
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.794
Wake up. Wake up.

1013
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.473
I'm sorry.

1014
01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.392
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1015
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.549
Jenny.

1016
01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.597
Jenny, please, wake up.

1017
01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:20.995
I'm sorry.

1018
01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.230
I don't know what I'm doing.

1019
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.389
Just, please, wake up.

1020
01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.200
Jenny.

1021
01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.834
Wake up, please.

1022
01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680
Just...

1023
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.229
Jenny, please, just wake up!

1024
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.636
Nick? Nick.

1025
01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:59.671
Nick. Nick.

1026
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.636
Nick...

1027
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.800
Nick.

1028
01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.995
Nick. Nick?

1029
01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.275
Stop!

1030
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.638
Stop. Please.

1031
01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.075
I don't know what I am.

1032
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.240
I don't want to
hurt you, Jenny.

1033
01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.355
You're alive.

1034
01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.759
You're alive.

1035
01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.990
I'm so glad you're alive.

1036
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.828
Oh, Nick.

1037
01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.879
You did this for me?

1038
01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.794
Yes.

1039
01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.353
I have made so many,
many mistakes.

1040
01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.951
But not this time.

1041
01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.399
Not you.

1042
01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.591
I don't want to hurt you.

1043
01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.796
I never wanted to hurt you.

1044
01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.559
You won't.

1045
01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.030
Didn't see this coming,
did we?

1046
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.877
They're coming for me.

1047
01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.914
I wish we had more time.

1048
01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.518
I'll find you.

1049
01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.395
Goodbye, Jenny.

1050
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.436
<i>You were wrong
about Nick.</i>

1051
01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.554
<i>He gave his life to save me.</i>

1052
01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.958
<i>To bring me back.</i>

1053
01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.598
Yes, Jennifer.

1054
01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.113
He found his redemption,
but at great cost.

1055
01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.871
He is a monster now.

1056
01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.235
<i>He is also still a man.</i>

1057
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.319
<i>A good man.</i>

1058
01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.553
<i>Perhaps.</i>

1059
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.278
<i>Yet he has only begun
to discover his power.</i>

1060
01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.992
<i>And we cannot know
which side will win out.</i>

1061
01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.431
Between darkness and light,

1062
01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.238
<i>good or evil.</i>

1063
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.951
Hey, Nick? Nick.

1064
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.791
I'm really glad to be here.

1065
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.080
I mean,
thank you for bringing me

1066
01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.912
back to life
and everything, Nick.

1067
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.991
But what are we
even doing here?

1068
01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.511
Where are we going?

1069
01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.192
Come on, my friend.

1070
01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.075
Where's your
sense of adventure?

1071
01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.509
Oh, no.

1072
01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.750
<i>Whatever human
part of him remains</i>

1073
01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.513
will search the world over
for a way to break the curse.

1074
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.913
<i>To find a cure.</i>

1075
01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.196
<i>Yet evil never rests.</i>

1076
01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.235
<i>And it will call to him</i>

1077
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.117
<i>always.</i>

1078
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.109
Henry, he used
his power to stop Ahmanet.

1079
01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.592
<i>You know more than anyone
he could be our greatest ally.</i>

1080
01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.508
<i>Perhaps.</i>

1081
01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.631
<i>Sometimes, it does take a
monster to fight a monster.</i>
